        <p>Hi there! I am a fourth-year mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo studying robotics, automation and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>
          I am currently in San Francisco interning for Pinterest's Homefeed Recommendation team. I will be joining Google in Los Angeles later this year as a machine learning infrastructure engineer. My previous internships were at Shopify, Rave Media, Kik and UW Formula Motorsports.

          I love filmography, and I like to make films in my free time. I play volleyball and tennis to stay active, and I hike and read to relax.
