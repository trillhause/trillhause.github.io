          <p>Co-op at University of Waterloo provides an amazing opportunity for students to try out different types of jobs before graduating. So far I have done two co-ops and they differ vastly. One was designing interfaces for a software company and other was manufacturing components for a Formula SAE race car.

            <span class="bold">Winter 2016:</span> I worked at WeMesh over the winter 2016 term. I was involved in developing the a VR client for WeMesh. This was my first job as a software developer and I learned a lot from the experience.

            <span class="bold">Summer 2015:</span> I worked as an UX/UI designer at Kik where I worked on some really great projects which increased daily user registration for kik messenger. I worked with designers, developers and product managers on projects/products to improve overall user experience of Kik messenger. I did this to follow my passion in designing and to get an overview of what life is like a designer.

            <span class="bold">Winter 2014:</span> Prior to doing a co-op at Kik, I did a co-op term at University of Waterloo Formula Motorsports as a Mechanical engineering co-op. I designed CAD models for complex vehicle components and manufactured them as required. The motivation behind this job was my curiosity at working in a workshop.</p>
