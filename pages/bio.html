    <p>Hello! I'm Millin, 2A Mechatronics Engineering student at University of Waterloo. I am a design oriented engineer and programmer who is interested in working on revolutionary products. I believe in delivering extraordinary user experience and visually ecstatic design.
      <br>
      <br>As a mechatronics major, my speciality lies in integrating hardware and software to create a seamless experience in an electromechanical system. My program mainly focuses on mechanical design, electrical circuits and computer control systems.</p>

          <p>Co-op at University of Waterloo provides an amazing opportunity for students to try out different types of jobs before graduating. So far I have done two co-ops and they differ vastly. One was designing interfaces for a software company and other was manufacturing components for a Formula SAE race car.

            <span class="bold">Summer 2015:</span> I worked as an UX/UI designer at Kik where I worked on some really great projects which increased daily user registration for kik messenger. I worked with designers, developers and product managers on projects/products to improve overall user experience of Kik messenger. I did this to follow my passion in designing and to get an overview of what life is like a designer.

            <span class="bold">Winter 2014:</span> Prior to doing a co-op at Kik, I did a co-op term at University of Waterloo Formula Motorsports as a Mechanical engineering co-op. I designed CAD models for complex vehicle components and manufactured them as required. The motivation behind this job was my curiosity at working in a workshop.</p>
