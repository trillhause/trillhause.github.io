        <p>Hi there! I am a fourth-year mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo studying robotics, automation and artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent my last two internships at Google in Los Angeles and Pinterest in San Francisco working on Machine Learning projects. My other internships were at Shopify, Rave Media, Kik and UW Formula Motorsports.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduate in April 2019 and I am currently planning the next chapter of my life.
