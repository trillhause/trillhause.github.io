    <p>Hi, I'm a third-year student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Mechatronics Engineering. I care about technology that contributes to the advancement of society.</p>

    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo is an amalgam of mechanical, electrical and computer engineering. I am planning to specialize in Robotics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in my final year by taking respective technical electives. Check out the list of courses I have taken so far in the history section below.</p>

    <h2>Internships</h2>
    <p>I plan to do a total of seven work terms before my graduation. I have done four so far and I am actively looking for the fifth internship for summer 2017.</p>
