        <p> Everyone has a tipping point in their lives when they realize that they have to be an adult and get work done. Most people realize this when they are in their last year of university, but there are some individuals that don't go through this transition at all. I am not talking about 30 year olds who are still acting as irresponsible college students. I am talking about those extremely smart people who have never had to go through this transition because they are already so self disciplined that the idea of work and play isnâ€™t embedded in their system.

          <br> Work and play system is something every kid goes through in his childhood. As a kid have to do work and then get to play in free time. Work for us a kid is to go to school, studying and doing chores our parents asks us to do. Play is the free time you get after you are don't with work. Most of the time we never get out of this system because it is deeply integrated in our lives. When we grow up, our 9to5 job becomes or work(exactly how school was as a kid) and the time we spend doing things we like becomes our play.
